\section{Introduction}

Since Heller first proposed the method in 1976\cite{jcp-64-63}, there have been several attempts to compute the dynamics of quantum systems by use of coupled Gaussian wave packets.

{\tt Systems treated}

{\tt Where the method worked}

{\tt When instabilities were noticed}

{\tt What people tried to do about them}

{\tt Proposal for quantum fields}

{\tt Wavelets and Gabor frames in the 1980s}

% If in two-column mode, this environment will change to single-column format so that long equations can be displayed. 
% Use only when necessary.

% Figures should be put into the text as floats. 
% Use the graphics or graphicx packages (distributed with LaTeX2e).
% See the LaTeX Graphics Companion by Michel Goosens, Sebastian Rahtz, and Frank Mittelbach for examples.

% Here is an example of the general form of a figure:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. 
% Put the label that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.

% \begin{figure}

% \caption{\label{}}%

% Tables may be be put in the text as floats.
% Here is an example of the general form of a table:
% Fill in the caption in the braces of the \caption{} command. Put the label
% that you will use with \ref{} command in the braces of the \label{} command.
% Insert the column specifiers (l, r, c, d, etc.) in the empty braces of the
% \begin{tabular}{} command.
