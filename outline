# I: Stiffness

B: The semi-implicit method is widely used for quantum Monte-Carlo simulations
P: No one knows how to set the timestep for convergence
C: Trial and error with big grids

Semi-implicit is method to solve ODEs, often used for methods of lines in Monte-Carlo simulations.  jkp-132-313, jkp-93-144.

symplectic in Hilbert space, until made iterative

power series, U commutes with H

Nyquist condition

parasitic solutions are amplified

could linearise the GPE around ψ(x,t), in which case frequencies of Bogoliubov modes would count.  usually the shortest wavelength modes would be shorter than the healing length, and the nonlinearity wouldn't make a difference.

numerical experiment

keeping space grid and time step in sync is well known, not so clear what this means for more exotic quantum representations, e.g. wave packets.  problem is really being able to represent high energy/high frequency states.

interacting particles are this type of Hamiltonian in second quantisation.  a state with a lot of particles has (a lot)² of interaction energy.

this is easy to solve if you magically know the eigenstates already, because you can truncate to low energy.  same as taking a coarser spatial grid in wave equations.

harder with expansions over non-energy-eigenstates, (e.g. wave packets), because superpositions can have higher energy than any of their components.

to be continued ...

(How should you include the high-energy dynamics if you need to?  Some kind of adiabatic treatment, maybe.)



# II: Wave packet expansions

See jcp-0-0.tex

B: people have tried to use Gaussian wave packets as a basis/variational approximant for a long time, but they are numerically ill-conditioned.
P: no one knows why
C: no one know how to fix it

## History

Why did any of this work?

## Restricting the problem

This paper will analyse the stability of a simpler method.  The
full method will have whatever stability problems this one does,
and possibly some extras of its own.

## Stability

TODO fix Figure 4, the plots of eigenvalues and regularised ones

Localised sets of coherent states can expand states with large energy.

Eigenvalues of discretised H are very similar to those of H

Effect of ill conditioned expansion matrix

# III: Squeezed state frame

See pra-0-0.scan.pdf and pra-0-1.tex

New idea on centres of squeezing.  Treat the Hushimi distribution as a mass density, and squeeze so that the moment of inertia is symmetric, with ΔX₁ = ΔX₂.  (Maybe a double-well is better illustrated with the vacuum state of a single well, though)

Idea: If |n〉 is the nth energy eigenstate, counting the ground state as |0〉, then 〈α|n〉 tends to e^{-inα} at infinity.  Kind of has to work for Bargmann orthogonality.  Goes wrong if the states are reordered, as in quartic oscillator.  Does it work for double wells?  Is there a way to construct the eigenstates from this?
