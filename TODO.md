Hypotheses
=======

When Schrödinger's equation is discretised over Hilbert space using coherent states, and variationally over time:

1. The discretisations of Hilbert space and time do not commute.  Discretising time first is stable, discretising to coherent states first is not.

2. The unstable method will be much more sensitive to how the initial state is discretised than the stable method.

3. This is due to stiffness of the unstable discretisation.

Tasks
====
1. Fix the instability of large number states.

5. Run experiment.

6. Find a good way to initialise the matrices.

6. Experiment with speed of sparse diagonal matrices

6. Experiment with speed of generators vs. matrix multiplication

3. Check that Methods 2 and 3 actually differ.

4. Think about the assymetry between state and time discretisations in Method 2.

2. Derive the brackets 〈N|H|N〉 and 〈N|H|ψ〉 for the Morse oscillator.

3. Choose time discretisations to compare.

4. Find sensible discretisations of the initial state for the quartic oscillator using AMPL.

5. Derive momentum-kicked ground state of Mores oscillator

4. Find sensible discretisations for the Morse oscillator using AMPL.

Topics to write
=====

1. Details of comparing stability by varying timestep and measuring error.

2. What can be learnt by varying energy of initial state.

3. What can be learnt by varying number of components.

4. Stability of different time discretisations.
