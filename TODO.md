Hypotheses
=======

When Schrödinger's equation is discretised over Hilbert space using coherent states, and variationally over time:

1. The discretisations of Hilbert space and time do not commute.  Discretising time first is stable, discretising to coherent states first is not.

2. The unstable method will be much more sensitive to how the initial state is discretised than the stable method.

3. This is due to stiffness of the unstable discretisation.

Tasks
====

2. Find a low-order discretisation that is easy to code.

2. Write down the three algorithms in detail.

2. Derive the bracket  〈n|H|ψ〉 for the Morse oscillator.

4. Code brackets in Python.


3. Choose time discretisations to compare.

4. Find sensible discretisations of the initial state for the quartic oscillator using AMPL.

5. Derive momentum-kicked ground state of Mores oscillator

4. Find sensible discretisations for the Morse oscillator using AMPL.

Topics to write
=====

1. Details of comparing stability by varying timestep and measuring error.

2. What can be learnt by varying energy of initial state.

3. What can be learnt by varying number of components.

4. Stability of different time discretisations.

Chores
=====

4. Install AMPL.
